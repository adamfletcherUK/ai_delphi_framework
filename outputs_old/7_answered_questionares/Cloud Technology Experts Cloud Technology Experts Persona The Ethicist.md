## Theme 1: Cost-Benefit Analysis
1. Transitioning from mainframes to a more modern infrastructure involves significant initial financial implications. These include costs for new hardware, software, IT consulting services for the transition process, and training expenses for staff. However, over the long term, modern infrastructures can offer substantial cost savings through reduced maintenance costs, improved efficiency, and the flexibility of scaling operations as per need. 

2. Key costs involved in the migration process include expenses for the migration tools, downtime costs during the transition, reengineering costs for applications, and costs for data cleansing. In comparison, long-term savings can be realized through more efficient operations, reduced energy consumption, lower maintenance costs, and the elimination of licensing fees associated with old systems.

## Theme 2: Technical Feasibility
3. Technical challenges can include data migration issues, the complexity of integrating new infrastructure with existing systems, and potential compatibility issues. There might also be challenges in maintaining data integrity and security during the transition.

4. Addressing compatibility issues requires careful planning and the use of middleware or other integration technologies. It may also involve reengineering or refactoring legacy applications to ensure they can function effectively on the new infrastructure.

## Theme 3: Training and Skill Gap
5. Upskilling and reskilling staff can be approached through a combination of on-the-job training, external courses, and mentorship programs. It is also important to foster a culture of continuous learning and provide resources for self-paced learning.

## Theme 4: Business Continuity
6. Ensuring minimal disruption to operations can be achieved by planning the transition in phases, starting with less critical systems, and maintaining a rollback plan in case issues arise. 

7. Contingency plans could include maintaining backup data and systems, having a dedicated response team for addressing migration issues, and implementing a robust disaster recovery plan.

## Theme 5: Vendor Selection
8. Potential vendors can be evaluated based on their technical expertise, previous experience with similar transitions, support services, cost proposal, and their alignment with the organization's ethical and data security standards.

## Theme 6: Cybersecurity
9. Addressing cybersecurity concerns involves conducting a thorough risk assessment before the transition, encrypting sensitive data, and implementing stringent access controls. 

10. Measures to improve cybersecurity posture include implementing a security incident and event management (SIEM) system, conducting regular audits, and keeping software and systems up-to-date.

## Theme 7: Regulatory Compliance
11. Transitioning to modern infrastructure might necessitate changes in compliance due to data locality laws, privacy concerns, or industry-specific regulations. Navigating these changes requires a thorough understanding of relevant laws and regulations, and possibly seeking legal counsel.

## Theme 8: Future-Proofing
12. Future-proofing the new infrastructure could involve choosing scalable solutions, investing in modular and interoperable technologies, and regularly updating and maintaining the system to accommodate future growth and technological advancements.

## Theme 9: Organizational Change Management
13. Managing the human side of the transition involves open and frequent communication about the changes, providing adequate training and support, and involving employees in the transition process to foster a change-friendly culture.

## Theme 10: Performance and Efficiency Gains
14. Potential improvements with the new infrastructure include faster data processing, improved system reliability, greater scalability, and enhanced ability to integrate with other technologies, leading to operational efficiency gains.
