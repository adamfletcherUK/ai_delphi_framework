Sure, here are my detailed responses to the questionnaire:

## Theme 1: Cost-Benefit Analysis
1. The transition from mainframes to modern infrastructure involves both upfront costs and potential long-term savings. Upfront costs include procurement of new hardware or cloud services, software licensing, and costs of migration (including labor, training, and potential downtime). Long-term savings come from reduced maintenance costs, increased efficiency, and the ability to leverage modern, cost-effective technologies. An accurate cost-benefit analysis would require a detailed understanding of the current costs of maintaining the mainframes, the projected costs of the new infrastructure, and the potential savings over a defined timeframe.
   
2. Key costs include hardware/software procurement or subscription costs, costs of data migration (which may involve data cleansing and transformation), training costs, and potential costs of downtime during the transition. These should be compared against potential long-term savings, such as reduced maintenance costs, increased operational efficiency, and the potential for innovation that can drive revenue growth. 

## Theme 2: Technical Feasibility
3. Technical challenges can include data migration (especially if the data is in legacy formats that modern systems don't support), software compatibility issues, network upgrades, and potential disruption to business operations during the transition. Each of these challenges can be addressed with careful planning, the use of migration tools, and potentially the assistance of vendors who specialize in such transitions.
   
4. Compatibility issues can be mitigated by using middleware, re-writing applications, or employing modernization tools that automatically convert legacy code to modern languages. In some cases, it might be feasible to replace legacy applications with modern, off-the-shelf software that provides similar functionality.

## Theme 3: Training and Skill Gap
5. Strategies for upskilling/reskilling staff can include on-the-job training, workshops, courses, or even partnerships with educational institutions. It's also important to foster a culture that values continuous learning and adapts to the changing technological landscape. This can be facilitated by leadership, HR policies, and the active involvement of all employees in the learning process.

## Theme 4: Business Continuity
6. Ensuring minimal disruption to operations can be achieved by careful planning and phased implementation. This might include running the new system in parallel with the old one for a period of time, allowing for a smoother transition and the opportunity to address any issues that arise without impacting business operations.
   
7. Contingency plans should involve having backup systems in place, a clear rollback strategy if problems occur, and perhaps even insurance to cover any unexpected costs. Risk assessment and mitigation should be integral parts of the migration plan.

## Theme 5: Vendor Selection
8. Potential vendors should be evaluated on their technical expertise, experience with similar transitions, cost-effectiveness, and their ability to provide ongoing support. It's also important to consider their cultural fit with the organization and their ability to work collaboratively with the internal team.

## Theme 6: Cybersecurity
9. Cybersecurity concerns can be addressed by conducting a thorough risk assessment, implementing robust security controls in the new infrastructure, and ensuring that all data is securely handled during the migration process.
   
10. Measures to maintain or improve cybersecurity posture can include implementing a security-first design, regular security testing, educating employees about security best practices, and staying abreast of the latest security threats and countermeasures.

## Theme 7: Regulatory Compliance
11. Changes in regulatory requirements can be anticipated by staying informed about regulatory trends and changes in the industry. Compliance can be ensured by involving legal and compliance experts in the transition process, and by designing the new infrastructure to be flexible and adaptable to changes in regulations.

## Theme 8: Future-Proofing
12. The new infrastructure should be scalable, modular, and adaptable to accommodate future growth and technological advancements. It should be built on open standards to avoid vendor lock-in and should be designed to integrate easily with other systems.

## Theme 9: Organizational Change Management
13. Managing the human side of the transition involves clear communication about the reasons for the change, the benefits it will bring, and the support that will be provided to employees during the transition. It also involves providing opportunities for employees to be involved in the transition process, and fostering a culture that views change as an opportunity for growth and improvement.

## Theme 10: Performance and Efficiency Gains
14. Potential improvements can include faster processing times, increased reliability, better data integration, and the ability to leverage modern technologies such as AI and machine learning. These improvements can lead to increased operational efficiency, better decision-making, and the potential for innovation and growth.
