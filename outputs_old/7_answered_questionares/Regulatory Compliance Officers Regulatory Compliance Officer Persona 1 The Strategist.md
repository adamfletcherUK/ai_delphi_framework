**Cost-Benefit Analysis**

1. The financial implications are multifaceted. Initially, there will be an upfront cost tied to purchasing new hardware, licensing new software, or subscribing to cloud services, and hiring expert consultants to aid in the transition. However, in the long run, modern infrastructures promise lower maintenance costs, better scalability, and increased productivity, which can significantly offset the initial expenses. It's also critical to consider the opportunity cost of not migrating. Staying with outdated technology may lead to higher costs in the future due to the increasing scarcity of mainframe specialists, escalating maintenance costs, and potential loss of competitive advantage.

2. The key costs involved are hardware or software expenses, consulting and professional service fees, potential downtime during the transition, and employee training. These costs can be substantial, but they must be weighed against the potential long-term savings from reduced maintenance costs, increased productivity, and the ability to innovate more quickly. A detailed cost-benefit analysis should be conducted to make an informed decision.

**Technical Feasibility**

3. Technical challenges include data migration, ensuring compatibility with existing systems, maintaining data integrity and security during the transition, and the potential for increased system complexity. It's crucial to have a clear migration roadmap and involve IT specialists who have experience with similar transitions.

4. Compatibility issues can be addressed through a phased approach, where legacy systems and new technologies run in parallel for a time. This allows for thorough testing and adjustments before a full switchover. Additionally, using middleware or APIs can help bridge the gap between old and new systems.

**Training and Skill Gap**

5. A twofold strategy can be effective. First, offer training programs to existing staff to upskill them, focusing on the most crucial areas related to the new infrastructure. Second, hire new employees with the needed skills. It's also important to foster a learning culture within the organization, encouraging employees to take charge of their learning journey.

**Business Continality**

6. To ensure minimal disruption, it's recommended to follow a phased transition approach, gradually migrating systems and processes instead of a sudden switchover. This allows for troubleshooting and adjustments in real-time. Moreover, having a detailed transition plan that includes clear timelines and responsibilities can help manage the process smoothly.

7. Contingency plans should include data backups and disaster recovery plans, having alternative systems or processes ready in case of significant issues, and ensuring sufficient resources are available to handle unexpected problems.

**Vendor Selection**

8. Criteria should include the vendor's experience and track record with similar projects, their technological capabilities, the cost of their services, their ability to provide post-implementation support, and their compliance with relevant regulations.

**Cybersecurity**

9. Cybersecurity concerns can be addressed by ensuring that the new infrastructure adheres to the latest security standards, conducting regular security audits, and implementing robust security practices such as data encryption and multi-factor authentication.

10. Measures could include a robust cybersecurity strategy that includes threat detection and response mechanisms, regular security training for employees, and staying up-to-date with the latest cybersecurity trends and threats.

**Regulatory Compliance**

11. Regulatory requirements may change with the new infrastructure, particularly if data is being moved to the cloud. It's essential to conduct a thorough analysis of the new regulatory landscape and develop a compliance strategy that accounts for these changes. This may involve working with legal experts or compliance consultants.

**Future-Proofing**

12. The new infrastructure should be scalable and flexible, allowing for future growth and technological advancements. This could involve adopting a cloud-based infrastructure, which can easily be scaled up or down, or investing in modular hardware that can be upgraded easily. 

**Organizational Change Management**

13. Managing the human side of the transition can involve clear communication about the reasons for the change and the benefits it will bring, providing training and support to help employees adapt, and involving employees in the transition process to foster a sense of ownership.

**Performance and Efficiency Gains**

14. The new infrastructure could bring several improvements, including faster processing times, greater system reliability, increased data storage and processing capabilities, and the ability to implement new technologies like AI and machine learning. These enhancements can lead to greater operational efficiency and a competitive advantage.
