## Theme 1: Cost-Benefit Analysis

1. Transitioning from mainframes to a modern infrastructure involves a comprehensive financial assessment. This includes the upfront costs of purchasing and setting up new hardware or procuring cloud services, software licensing costs, and the expenses of data migration, including potential downtime costs. Additionally, the long-term operational costs of the new system, including maintenance, support, and energy consumption, should be factored in. When calculating the return on investment, consider the potential cost savings from improved productivity, enhanced business agility, risk reduction, and lower maintenance costs. 

2. Key costs in the migration process include the cost of new hardware or cloud service subscriptions, software licenses, data migration tools, labor costs for implementation and configuration, training costs, and potential regulatory compliance costs. Long-term savings would come from reduced maintenance and support costs, improved efficiency resulting in higher productivity, and potential revenue growth due to enhanced agility and responsiveness to market changes.

## Theme 2: Technical Feasibility

3. Technical challenges may include compatibility issues between legacy systems and modern infrastructure, potential data loss during migration, adapting old business processes to new systems, ensuring data security during and after the transition, and testing the new system to ensure it meets business needs.

4. To address compatibility issues, detailed mapping of data structures between the old and new systems is required. This may involve creating custom scripts or using middleware. Thorough testing should be conducted to ensure data integrity. Additionally, data cleansing might be necessary to ensure only accurate and relevant data is migrated to the new system.

## Theme 3: Training and Skill Gap

5. Staff training can be addressed through a combination of on-the-job training, formal courses, workshops, and e-learning modules. It's vital to assess the current skill level of staff and identify the skills needed for the new infrastructure. Training should be progressive and well-paced, starting with basic system knowledge before moving to more advanced operations.

## Theme 4: Business Continuity

6. To ensure minimal disruption during transition, a phased approach can be adopted, transitioning one business unit at a time. A detailed migration schedule should be developed, with provisions for rollback in the event of issues. Backup systems should be in place to ensure business continuity during the transition.

7. Contingency plans should include comprehensive disaster recovery and rollback plans. Regular backups and audits should be conducted, and a crisis management team should be established to handle unforeseen issues.

## Theme 5: Vendor Selection

8. Potential vendors should be evaluated on their technical capabilities, experience with similar migrations, understanding of our industry and its regulatory requirements, support services, and cost. Customer testimonials and case studies should also be considered.

## Theme 6: Cybersecurity

9. Cybersecurity concerns can be addressed by ensuring the new infrastructure adheres to industry best practices and relevant regulations. This includes configuring firewalls, securing data transmission, managing user access, and regularly updating and patching systems.

10. Measures to improve cybersecurity include implementing advanced threat detection and response systems, conducting regular security audits, and maintaining a robust incident response plan.

## Theme 7: Regulatory Compliance

11. Anticipating regulatory changes requires a proactive approach, closely monitoring regulatory updates and understanding their implications. A compliance team should be established to ensure the new infrastructure adheres to all current and foreseeable regulations.

## Theme 8: Future-Proofing

12. The new infrastructure should be scalable and flexible, capable of accommodating growth and adapting to technological advancements. Adopting cloud services can provide the necessary scalability, while a modular design can allow for the integration of new technologies as they emerge.

## Theme 9: Organizational Change Management

13. Managing the human side of the transition requires clear communication, active involvement of employees in the transition process, and addressing resistance through education and support. A culture of change can be fostered by highlighting the benefits of the new system and rewarding those who embrace the change.

## Theme 10: Performance and Efficiency Gains

14. Potential improvements include faster processing times, higher system availability, improved data analytics capabilities, better customer service due to quicker response times, and more efficient resource utilization. These gains would result in higher productivity and potentially increased revenue.
