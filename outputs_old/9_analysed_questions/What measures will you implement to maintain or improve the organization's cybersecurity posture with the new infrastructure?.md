### Comprehensive Summary of Responses:

The responses across various expert personas converge on several key measures to maintain or improve an organization's cybersecurity posture in light of new infrastructure. These include the implementation of advanced security technologies (such as threat detection and response systems, encryption, and firewalls), regular security audits and updates, and the importance of fostering a culture of security awareness through continuous employee training. Additionally, the adoption of a zero-trust security model and the development of robust incident response plans are frequently mentioned. There's a strong emphasis on the need for a proactive approach to security, including ongoing monitoring and rapid response to potential threats, as well as the necessity of staying updated with the latest security trends and threats.

### Detailed Analysis of Areas of Consensus:

1. **Advanced Security Technologies**: There's a broad consensus on the necessity of incorporating advanced security measures, including threat detection systems, encryption, and intrusion prevention systems, into the new infrastructure.
2. **Regular Security Audits and Updates**: Experts agree on the critical importance of conducting regular security audits and ensuring systems and software are promptly updated to guard against emerging threats.
3. **Employee Training and Awareness**: The need for continuous cybersecurity training and the development of a security-aware culture within the organization are consistently highlighted across responses.
4. **Incident Response Plans**: The creation and maintenance of a robust incident response plan to quickly address any potential security breaches is another area of strong agreement.
5. **Proactive Security Posture**: A general consensus exists on the value of adopting a proactive approach to security, which includes continuous monitoring and staying abreast of the latest cybersecurity practices and threats.

### In-Depth Exploration of Areas of Divergence:

1. **Security Frameworks and Models**: While there is consensus on the use of advanced security technologies, experts diverge on the specific frameworks or models to adopt, with mentions of zero-trust security models, layered security approaches, and the use of SIEM systems.
2. **Technological vs. Human-Centric Approaches**: Some responses emphasize the implementation of technical measures (e.g., firewalls, encryption), whereas others stress the importance of human factors, such as ongoing staff training and fostering a security-conscious culture.
3. **Scope of Security Measures**: Differences emerge in the extent and scope of security measures proposed, ranging from basic security practices to the suggestion of incorporating AI and machine learning for threat detection and response.
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: While several responses highlight the importance of adhering to regulations and standards, the degree to which this is emphasized varies, with some experts placing a stronger focus on compliance as a key component of cybersecurity posture.
5. **Security in Design vs. Post-Implementation Security Measures**: There's a divergence in views regarding when security measures should be implemented, with some advocating for a security-first design in the new infrastructure, while others emphasize post-implementation security technologies and practices.
