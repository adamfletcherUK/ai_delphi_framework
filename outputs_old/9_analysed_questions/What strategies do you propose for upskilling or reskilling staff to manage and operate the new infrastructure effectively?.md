### Comprehensive Summary of Responses:

Across the diverse perspectives from IT Infrastructure Specialists, Cost Analysts, Project Managers, Cloud Technology Experts, Mainframe Technologists, Cybersecurity Professionals, Organizational Change Specialists, Regulatory Compliance Officers, and Data Migration Specialists, a unified theme emerges: the essential nature of upskilling or reskilling staff to manage and operate new infrastructure effectively. Common strategies suggested include a blend of in-house training, external courses, hands-on experience, and fostering a culture of continuous learning. Several respondents highlighted the importance of conducting a skills gap analysis to tailor training efforts effectively. Partnerships with technology vendors for specialized training, the implementation of mentorship programs, and the encouragement of certifications were also frequently mentioned. Additionally, the need for a flexible, ongoing learning approach that adapts to evolving technologies was underscored.

### Detailed Analysis of Areas of Consensus:

1. **Blended Learning Approach:** A strong consensus exists around adopting a blended learning strategy, incorporating in-house training, external courses, and practical hands-on experience.
2. **Skills Gap Analysis:** There is a shared recognition of the importance of identifying existing skill gaps through audits or assessments as a preliminary step in developing effective training programs.
3. **Partnerships for Specialized Training:** Many experts advocate for leveraging partnerships with technology vendors or external training providers to access specialized knowledge, particularly in areas like cloud computing and cybersecurity.
4. **Culture of Continuous Learning:** A recurring theme is the emphasis on creating and nurturing a culture that values continuous learning and development, recognizing that technology and business needs will continue to evolve.
5. **Mentorship and Support:** The implementation of mentorship programs, where more experienced staff guide less experienced ones, and the provision of ongoing support and resources for self-paced learning, are seen as critical components of an effective upskilling strategy.

### In-Depth Exploration of Areas of Divergence:

1. **Role of New Hiring:** Divergence is noted in approaches to integrating new talent with necessary skills. Some experts suggest focusing primarily on training existing staff, while others recommend a balanced approach that includes hiring new talent.
2. **Utilization of Vendor Support:** Opinions vary on the extent to which organizations should rely on vendor support for training. Some see it as a supplementary measure, whereas others consider it a cornerstone of their training strategy.
3. **Emphasis on Certifications:** While many respondents see value in staff obtaining relevant certifications, there's variability in how much emphasis is placed on this aspect, with some viewing it as beneficial but not central.
4. **Targeted vs. Comprehensive Training:** There's a split between advocating for targeted training programs focused on specific needs and comprehensive training that covers a broader range of skills and knowledge.
5. **Approach to Continuous Learning:** While there's agreement on the importance of continuous learning, perspectives differ on how to institutionalize this within an organization, ranging from formal policies and programs to more informal, culture-driven approaches.

### Strategic Formulation of Open-Ended Areas for Further Exploration:

1. **How can organizations balance the cost and resource allocation for upskilling programs with the immediate operational demands of implementing new infrastructure?**
2. **What are the most effective metrics and tools for assessing the impact of upskilling and reskilling efforts on operational efficiency and staff proficiency in the new infrastructure?**
3. **In what ways can partnerships with technology vendors be optimized to ensure they provide not just training but also ongoing support tailored to the evolving needs of the organization?**
4. **How can organizations foster a genuine culture of continuous learning, beyond formal training programs, to encourage proactive self-development among staff?**
5. **What role can mentorship programs play in complementing formal training efforts, and how can they be structured to maximize benefits for both mentors and mentees?**

This structured approach to analyzing the expert feedback not only highlights the consensus and divergences within the panel but also opens avenues for deepening the inquiry into how best to equip staff with the necessary skills to navigate new technological landscapes effectively.
