Comprehensive Summary of Responses:

The consensus among experts across diverse fields, including IT Infrastructure Specialists, Cost Analysts, Project Managers, Cloud Technology Experts, Mainframe Technologists, Cybersecurity Professionals, Organizational Change Specialists, Regulatory Compliance Officers, and Data Migration Specialists, highlights that the migration process incurs significant upfront costs. These costs broadly encompass hardware and software procurement, professional services (including migration tools and consultancy fees), training, and potential operational disruptions during the transition. Despite the variance in emphasis, a common thread is the anticipation of long-term savings from reduced maintenance and operational costs, increased efficiency, and the potential for revenue growth through enhanced agility and leveraging modern technologies.

Detailed Analysis of Areas of Consensus:

1. **Upfront Costs**: Uniformly acknowledged across responses, with a particular focus on hardware/software procurement, professional services, and training.
2. **Operational Disruptions**: Recognized as a significant cost factor, with potential downtime during migration mentioned by nearly all personas.
3. **Long-term Savings**: A universally agreed-upon benefit, with specifics including reduced maintenance costs, energy savings, and improved operational efficiency.
4. **Enhanced Business Capabilities**: Many experts highlighted the ability to leverage modern technologies for business growth and innovation as a key long-term benefit.
5. **Risk of Technological Obsolescence**: Several responses mentioned the cost of not migrating, emphasizing missed opportunities and the risk of relying on outdated technology.

In-Depth Exploration of Areas of Divergence:

1. **Weighting of Costs vs. Benefits**: There's variance in how different personas weigh immediate costs against long-term savings, with some placing more emphasis on the strategic benefits of migration.
2. **Specific Cost Components**: While all acknowledge the general categories of costs, there's divergence in the emphasis on specific costs like data migration, downtime, and regulatory compliance.
3. **Perceived Value of Modern Technologies**: Some responses suggest a stronger belief in the transformative potential of modern technologies than others, affecting the perceived long-term value of migration.
4. **Sector-Specific Concerns**: Differences emerge based on the sector-specific focus of some personas, such as cybersecurity and regulatory compliance, highlighting unique concerns and benefits.
5. **Approach to Risk Management**: Variance in how risk is managed and mitigated during the migration process, with some personas focusing more on strategic planning and others on operational efficiency.

Strategic Formulation of Open-Ended Areas for Further Exploration:

1. **How can organizations best balance the immediate costs of migration against the promise of long-term savings and benefits?**
2. **In what ways can the risk of operational disruptions during migration be minimized, and how can downtime be effectively managed?**
3. **What specific strategies can organizations employ to leverage modern technologies for maximum business growth and innovation post-migration?**
4. **How do sector-specific concerns, such as cybersecurity and regulatory compliance, affect the migration process, and what tailored approaches can address these?**
5. **Can a framework be developed to more accurately predict and quantify the long-term benefits of migration, including increased operational efficiency and revenue growth?**
