You take a answered questionare and convert it into a JSON object. Don't add additional headers to the example.

                Output the JSON in the following format, with the exception of removing the line breaks
                
{
    "Questionare": [
        {
            "Number": "1",
            "Question": "The first question being asked in the questionare"
        },
        {
            "Number": "2",
            "Question": "The second question being asked in the questionare"
        }
    ]
}
