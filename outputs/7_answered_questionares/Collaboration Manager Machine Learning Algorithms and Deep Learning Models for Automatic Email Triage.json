{"Answers": [{"Question": "1", "Response": ["a. Data anonymization: Remove or obfuscate personally identifiable information from email text, such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, and other sensitive data points.", "b. Access control: Implement strict access controls to ensure only authorized personnel can view sensitive data.", "c. Encryption: Use encryption techniques to protect data at rest and in transit during preprocessing and model training.", "d. Data minimization: Store and process the minimum amount of personal data necessary for model training, avoiding excessive collection or storage of unnecessary information.", "e. Compliance with regulations: Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations, such as GDPR, CCPA, or HIPAA, depending on the jurisdiction and nature of the data."]}, {"Question": "2", "Response": ["a. Tokenization: Break down email text into individual tokens (words, phrases, or sentences) to simplify text analysis.", "b. Stopword removal: Remove common words that do not carry significant meaning, such as 'the,' 'and,' and 'a.'", "c. Stemming/lemmatization: Reduce words to their base form, improving model performance by reducing the vocabulary size and capturing semantic relationships between words.", "d. Noise removal: Remove unnecessary or redundant information, such as email signatures, disclaimers, or quote chains, to focus on relevant content."]}, {"Question": "3", "Response": ["a. Na\u00efve Bayes classifiers: Quick and efficient for text classification tasks with relatively high performance in filtering spam emails.", "b. Support Vector Machines (SVM): Offer good performance when dealing with high-dimensional data, such as email text features.", "c. Random Forests: Ensemble method that can handle nonlinear decision boundaries and reduce overfitting risk.", "d. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Deep learning models that can capture complex patterns and dependencies within email text, although they may require larger datasets and computational resources."]}, {"Question": "4", "Response": ["a. Leveraging large pre-trained language models to extract meaningful features from email text.", "b. Fine-tuning these models on specific email triaging tasks, allowing them to capture task-specific patterns and nuances within the data."]}, {"Question": "5", "Response": ["a. Manual annotation by domain experts or crowdsourcing platforms with quality control measures in place.", "b. Active learning techniques to identify and prioritize samples that, when labeled, provide the most significant performance boost to the model.", "c. Semi-supervised approaches like self-training or co-training to leverage both unlabeled and labeled data for model training."]}, {"Question": "8", "Response": ["a. Developing APIs or connectors to facilitate seamless data exchange between systems.", "b. Using secure communication protocols, such as HTTPS or SFTP, for transmitting sensitive data.", "c. Implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) and authentication mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access the model and its predictions."]}, {"Question": "9", "Response": ["a. Regular monitoring of model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.", "b. Evaluating fairness and bias in model predictions by analyzing performance across different demographic groups or email categories.", "c. Implementing retraining strategies to incorporate new data or updated labeling standards as needed."]}, {"Question": "10", "Response": ["a. Regular meetings between research teams, IT staff, and end-users to discuss model performance, limitations, and potential improvements.", "b. Providing user-friendly interfaces or tools for end-users to report issues or suggest improvements directly.", "c. Establishing clear communication channels and expectations regarding model updates, maintenance, and support."]}]}
