{"Answers": [{"Question": "Data Preprocessing 1", "Response": ["When handling Protected Information Identification (PII) and sensitive data within emails during the deployment of a machine learning model, it's crucial to follow best practices such as: ", "- Data anonymization: Replace personally identifiable information with artificial identifiers or tokens. ", "- Data pseudonymization: Use irreversible functions to replace sensitive data elements, preserving relationships between data points. ", "- Access control and encryption: Implement strict access controls for sensitive data and use encryption during transmission and storage."]}, {"Question": "Data Preprocessing 2", "Response": ["Text preprocessing techniques I recommend include: ", "- Tokenization: Break text into smaller units like words or phrases. ", "- Stopword removal: Eliminate common words that do not contribute to the meaning (e.g., 'the,' 'and'). ", "- Stemming/lemmatization: Reduce words to their base form for improved model generalization. ", "- Noise removal: Remove unnecessary elements like HTML tags, special characters, or numbers if they don't add value."]}, {"Question": "Machine Learning Model Selection 3", "Response": ["In automatic email triaging, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Random Forest algorithms have proven effective. For more complex tasks, deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) can be used."]}, {"Question": "Machine Learning Model Selection 4", "Response": ["Transfer learning and fine-tuning pre-trained language models like BERT and RoBERTa improve understanding of context and nuances in email text by: ", "- Inheriting knowledge from large pre-trained datasets, capturing linguistic patterns and semantics.
