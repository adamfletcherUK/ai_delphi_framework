{"Answers": [{"Question": "1", "Response": ["a. Data anonymization: Replacing personally identifiable information with artificial identifiers to prevent unauthorized disclosure.", "b. Differential privacy: Adding noise to the dataset during analysis to protect individual privacy without significantly impacting overall accuracy.", "c. Access control: Implementing strict access permissions and authentication protocols to ensure that only authorized personnel can view sensitive data.", "d. Encryption: Using encryption algorithms to secure data both at rest and in transit, protecting it from unauthorized access or interception."]}, {"Question": "2", "Response": ["a. Tokenization: Breaking down email text into individual words or tokens for easier processing.", "b. Stop word removal: Excluding common words like 'the,' 'and,' and 'a' from analysis, as they often add little meaning to the context.", "c. Stemming/lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form for improved vocabulary management and performance.", "d. Noise removal: Filtering out irrelevant information like HTML tags, special characters, or email headers that do not contribute to the content's meaning."]}, {"Question": "3", "Response": ["Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Random Forest algorithms have proven effective for automatic email triaging. For deep learning models, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can capture complex patterns in text data."]}, {"Question": "4", "Response": ["Transfer learning and fine-tuning pre-trained language models like BERT and RoBERTa improve context understanding by leveraging large amounts of general domain text data. These models are already proficient at capturing linguistic nuances, so they require less labeled data for specific tasks like email triaging."]}, {"Question": "5", "Response": ["a. Manual annotation: Hiring human annotators to categorize emails according to predefined criteria.", "b. Active learning: Selecting the most informative samples for manual annotation based on model uncertainty or entropy, reducing overall labeling efforts.", "c. Semi-supervised approaches: Using a combination of unsupervised and supervised techniques, such as clustering and label propagation, to generate labeled data with minimal human intervention."]}, {"Question": "6", "Response": ["Active learning techniques can minimize labeling efforts by strategically selecting the most informative samples for annotation based on model uncertainty or entropy. By focusing on these critical samples, active learning helps maximize model performance while minimizing manual effort."]}, {"Question": "7", "Response": ["For assessing model performance in automatic email triaging, precision, recall, and F1 score are appropriate evaluation metrics. Cross-validation and stratified sampling are recommended validation strategies to ensure that the model generalizes well and is not overfitting."]}, {"Question": "11", "Response": ["a. Real-time monitoring: Using tools like Prometheus or Grafana to monitor model performance in real-time, identifying potential issues or biases.", "b. Regular audits: Periodically reviewing the model's performance and updating it based on new data, changing requirements, or identified issues.", "c. User feedback: Encouraging end-users to report any incorrect categorizations or other issues, allowing for continuous refinement of the model."]}, {"Question": "10", "Response": ["a. Establishing secure data pipelines and APIs for exchanging information between the machine learning model and other systems.", "b. Using middleware or message brokers like Apache Kafka to decouple components, ensuring loose coupling and high availability.", "c. Implementing monitoring and logging tools to track performance, identify issues, and ensure smooth operation."]}, {"Question": "12", "Response": ["Collaboration between the research team, IT staff, and end-users can be encouraged through regular meetings, workshops, or training sessions to discuss model performance, gather user feedback, and share best practices. This collaboration ensures that all stakeholders are engaged and informed throughout the model's lifecycle, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and learning."]}]}
