{"Answers": [{"Question": "1", "Response": ["a. Data anonymization: Replace or remove all personally identifiable information from email text, ensuring that individual users cannot be traced.", "b. Encryption: Employ encryption protocols during data storage and transmission to protect sensitive information.", "c. Access control: Limit access to the dataset using strict role-based access controls and regular audits.", "d. Regular updates: Stay informed about evolving regulations, such as GDPR or HIPAA, and update your procedures accordingly."]}, {"Question": "2", "Response": ["a. Tokenization: Break down text into smaller units (tokens) for analysis, typically words or phrases.", "b. Stopwords removal: Exclude common words like 'and,' 'the,' and 'a' that do not contribute significantly to model performance.", "c. Lemmatization/stemming: Reduce words to their base form (lemma) or root form (stem), improving generalizability and reducing dimensionality.", "d. Noise removal: Filter out irrelevant content such as URLs, numbers, or email signatures that can negatively impact model performance."]}, {"Question": "3", "Response": ["a. Na\u00efve Bayes classifiers", "b. Support Vector Machines (SVM)", "c. Random Forests", "d. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)", "e. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)", "f.

Improve context understanding by leveraging large text corpora to pre-train the model, then fine-tune it on your specific task with labeled data.", "b. BERT, RoBERTa, or DistilBERT are examples of popular transformer-based architectures suitable for this purpose."]}, {"Question": "5", "Response": ["a. Manual annotation: Use in-house personnel, crowdsourcing platforms, or specialized annotation services to create labels.", "b. Semi-supervised approaches: Use techniques like self-training, multi-view training, or co-training to leverage unlabeled data for model improvement."]}, {"Question": "6", "Response": ["a. Query-by-committee: Select samples with high uncertainty according to multiple models (the committee).", "b. Core-set selection: Choose representative samples that capture the diversity of the dataset.", "c.
