Objective: To create a robust text preprocessing pipeline for the machine learning model's input data, ensuring that the email content is effectively represented and prepared for classification tasks while protecting sensitive information.

Approach:

Text Preprocessing Fundamentals: Begin by applying core preprocessing techniques (tokenization, stopwords removal, stemming/lemmatization) to the email dataset, creating a vocabulary for the machine learning model and reducing linguistic complexity.

Sensitive Data Handling: Implement Protected Information Identification (PII) methods to safeguard sensitive information within emails, ensuring privacy and security throughout the data preprocessing stage.

Noise Removal: Filter out irrelevant information, such as HTML tags, special characters, or numbers that do not contribute to the meaning of the text, further streamlining the dataset for machine learning.

Customization and Iteration: Collaborate with the research team to refine and adapt the preprocessing pipeline based on the specific needs and challenges of email data, iteratively improving performance and addressing issues as they emerge.

Expected Outcome: A finely tuned text preprocessing pipeline that effectively represents email content, protects sensitive information, and facilitates robust machine learning model performance for automatic email triaging. This contribution will enable the research team to explore and understand nuances within email text more accurately, ultimately informing the development of a sophisticated model capable of enhancing efficiency and accuracy in email management.
