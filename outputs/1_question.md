# Deployment of Machine Learning Model to automatically triage emails that enter our centre

We get around 2-5 million emails a day for various requests, which need to be sent to different departments. 

This was originally done manually but the number of requests got too large.
We then did some automatic screening for words based upon a dictionary - but this is error prone.

We want to explore the use of machine learning and AI to tag emails and shuttle them to the correct department.

We want to determine what are the best methods of using or training an AI to do this for us. 
We need it to be scalable and easily deployable and well as secure.

The data within these emails will contain PII and other sensitive IP information.
