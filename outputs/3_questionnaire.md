 # Deployment of Machine Learning Model to Automatically Triage Emails

## Data Preprocessing

1. What are the best practices for handling Protected Information Identification (PII) and sensitive data within emails when deploying a machine learning model?
2. Which text preprocessing techniques, such as tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, and noise removal, would you recommend to optimize the performance of the machine learning model?

## Machine Learning Model Selection

3. In the context of automatic email triaging, which machine learning algorithms or deep learning models have proven to be most effective?
4. How can transfer learning and fine-tuning pre-trained language models like BERT and RoBERTa improve the model's understanding of context and nuances within email text?

## Training Data Generation

5. What strategies would you suggest for generating high-quality labeled data, either through manual annotation or semi-supervised approaches, to ensure a diverse and representative dataset?
6. How can active learning techniques be employed to minimize labeling efforts while maximizing model performance by strategically selecting the most informative samples for annotation?

## Model Evaluation

7. Which evaluation metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1 score) and validation strategies (e.g., cross-validation, stratified sampling) would be appropriate for assessing model performance in automatic email triaging?
8. How should the machine learning model's performance be benchmarked against the existing rule-based system to evaluate improvements in accuracy and efficiency?

## Scalability and Deployment

9. What factors should be considered when designing a scalable architecture for deploying the machine learning model in production, including parallel processing, distributed computing, and cloud infrastructure?
10. How can secure and seamless integration with existing systems, such as data pipelines, email servers, and departmental workflows, be ensured during deployment?

## Continuous Improvement

11. What feedback loops should be established to monitor model performance in real-time, identify potential issues or biases, and implement updates as needed?
12. How can collaboration between the research team, IT staff, and end-users (i.e., departments receiving the emails) be encouraged for ongoing refinement of the machine learning model?
